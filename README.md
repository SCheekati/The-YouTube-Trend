YouTube is the world's largest video sharing platform available for creators and businesses to host their content. The trending page is notable for boosting viewership and putting videos in the spotlight for people to like, share, comment, and subscribe to the respective channels.

In this project, we aim to build models that can predict whether a video will become a trending video on YouTube. This will allow us to better understand the factors that YouTube considers when deciding which videos to feature on the trending page.
